# Decorators.py

A debugging aid. The decorators output messages to tell me where the program has gotten to and how long it took.

## timeit
Useful for seeing how long methods take to execute

## FPS  
Similar to timeit but calculates the FPS (inverse time)

## traceit  
Just prints the method name

## tracebot
like traceit but adds 'robot:'. All __init__ calls are alike otherwise.  
Meant to be used in Robot.py method tracing.

## tracecam  
Like tracebot but for Camera.py - it adds 'cam:' to the output.
