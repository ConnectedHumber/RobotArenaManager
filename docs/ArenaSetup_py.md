# ArenaSetup.py

This utility lets you adjust the min/max sizes of the robot features so that the ArenaProcessing.py can categorise them as robot, id dot and heading indicator.

This image doesn't show the user panel but it does show each robot (actually just 8 static hats) together with their location and heading on the preview screen.
