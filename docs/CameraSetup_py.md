# CameraSetup.py

This is a Tkinter app which provides a number of spinners to change camera parameters whilst observing the effects on the BGR, GRAY, THRESH and EDGES images.

It's a bit simple - if you type a value into a spinbox you need to click up/down to send it to the camera - room for improvement.

When you are happy that your EDGES image has nice clean edges click the save button to update the Settings.json data file. 

TODO: I'll add screen shots  later
