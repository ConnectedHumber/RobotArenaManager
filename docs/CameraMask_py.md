# CameraMask.py

A small utility to alllow you to adjust the mask used by the image processor. The mask is used to exclude areas outside the arena, which would cost time, to process but are of no interest.

You can change the mask width/height independently and save the mask back to the Settings.json data file.

As you can see in this picture, there's the edge of a bed at the top but it isn't inside the masked area. My test Arena is, currently just 2 A3 foam art boards.
